This repository contains a C program designed to calculate the square root of a given number with a specified precision. The program uses an iterative method to approximate the square root and allows the user to define the number of decimal places for accuracy. It handles special cases such as negative numbers and zero, ensuring accurate results. Users can compile and run the program to input their desired number and precision, and the program will output the square root with the specified number of decimal places. This project is a practical implementation of numerical methods for educational and functional purposes.
